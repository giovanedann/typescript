/*
  A Decorator is a special kind of declaration that can be attached to a class declaration, method, accessor, property, or parameter.
  Decorators use the form @expression, where expression must evaluate to a function that will be called at runtime with information about the decorated declaration.
  Decorators can observe, change and completely modify what he's attached.

/*
  In classes decorators, imagine if you created a class, and you can change (add methods, add property) it without modifying the superclass.
  To do that, we need to use a decorator.
  A decorator will behaviour like the superclass, allowing to make modifications on the class, or executing methods that are not on
  the superclass, before returning the superclass itself.
