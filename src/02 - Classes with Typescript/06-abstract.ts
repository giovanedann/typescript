/*
  In TypeScript, classes, methods and attributes may be abstracts.

  Abstract classes CANNOT BE INSTANTIATED DIRECTLY, only subclasses of it.

  An abstract method or abstract field is one that hasn‚Äôt had an implementation provided. These members
  must exist inside an abstract class, which cannot be directly instantiated. The role of abstract classes
  is to serve as a base class for subclasses which do implement all the abstract members. When a class doesn‚Äôt
  have any abstract members, it is said to be concrete.

  abstract class methods doesn't have a body, you just call it inside the super class to make it required,
  so every child of this class need to implement this method or attribute.

  If you forget to implement the base class‚Äôs abstract members, TypeScript will return an error.
