/*
  The any type allows you to store a value of any type. It instructs the compiler to skip
  type checking. You usually use any type to store a value that you donâ€™t actually know
  its type at the compile-time or when you migrate a JavaScript project over to a
  TypeScript project. If you are starting a new project using TypeScript, you should avoid
  using the any type.
